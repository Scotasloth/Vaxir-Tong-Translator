# **Vaxir Tong Language Translator to English (Python Project)**

## **Overview**

This Python project aims to provide a simple language translation tool that translates text from "Vaxir Tong," a language created for a personal book-writing project, to English. It uses Microsoft Access databases as the translation source and leverages the power of Python along with the `pyodbc` library to connect to and query the Access database.

## **Features**

- **Translates text from "Vaxir Tong" to English.**
- **Utilizes a Microsoft Access database as the translation source.**
- **Provides an easy-to-use command-line interface, gui to be added in future commits**

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
